# Docker Image

I will upload the Docker Image to Docker Hub once I finish the implementation, I will first use an Ubuntu 20.04 image with Python 10 and conda, where I will also try to provide the visualization of data.

In case that I do not upload the Image, I will upload the Dockerfile for compilation.
